# Merge Intervals
- this pattern deals with problems involving overlapping intervals
- each interval is represented by a start and end time
- the most common problems solved using these pattern are event scheduling, resource allocation, and time slot consolidation
- understanding how two intervals may overlap a the key to understanding the pattern

**Non-overlapping intervals:** the second interval starts after the end of the first interval
**Partially overlapping interval:** the second interval starts before the first interval ends and ends after the first interval has ended. 
**completely overlapping intervals:** the second interval starts after the first interval has started, and ends before the end of the first interval.

## Does your problem match this pattern
- Array of intervals as your input data
- dealing with overlapping intervals to find their union, intersection or gaps.

## Real World problems
- Display busy schedule
- Schedule a new meeting
- Task scheduling in operating systems
