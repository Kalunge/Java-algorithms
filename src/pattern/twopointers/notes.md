# Two Pointers
- it is a versatile technique used to traverse linear data structures such as arrays, linked lists, etc.
- as the name suggests, it involves maintaining two pointers used to traverse from opposite sides or moving in differenct directions, or at different speeds
- they do so with optimal space and time complexity. 
- whenever there is a need to find to data elements in an array that satisfy different conditions, this pattern should always come to mind

## Does your problem match this pattern
**Yes if**
- if we are dealing with a linear data structure
- if we need to process pairs i.e data elements at two different positions simultaneously
- dynamic pointer movement

## Real world problems
- memory management - allocation and deallocation
