# Fast and Slow Pointers
- just like the two pointers pattern, this is used to traverse an iterable data structure but at different speeds and to find a target. 
- it is mostly used to identify cycles
- whereas the two pointers pattern is mostly useful in comparing values, this pattern is typicaly used to analyze the data structure or properties
- it is also known as the hare and tortoise pattern as one pointer moves faster than the other. 
- if there is a cycle the faster pointer will overlap the slower cycle

## Does our problem match this pattern
- yes if it is a linear data structure e.g array, linkedlist, string e.t.c
- cycle or intersection detection
- find the starting element at the second quantile

## Real world problems
- Symlink verification
- OOP compilation
